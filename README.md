HackingEDU application to help people find local and timely help with studies

We are a new-born team, making a ClassInTouch project. It’s based on the idea of locality and mutual help. We believe that no one wants to fill in his interests, but that’s great: this can be mined and derived automatically!
We created a platform to find common interests based on public social profile, geolocation and time series analysis of recurring events (i.e. lessons) to discover people who can help you!


## Why?
We met at hackathon [https://hackingedu.co](HackingEDU) and decided to make it.
The idea belonged to Justin, as far as I recall.
