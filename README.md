# ClassInTouch
The best way to get in touch with your classmates

## What
ClassInTouch allows users to create a community in a single button press, without any setup or involvement by a teacher or socialite. It's never been simpler to connect with others and get help in seconds. We use the user's location and the time of their class to "Register" them for the course. This guarantees that students will be talking to their peers, and they don't need to ask other's for credentials. It's just the best way to connect with your peers.

### Our 10-second promise
Communication should be fast. In ten seconds, you can find your class and start talking.
* Click Log in with Facebook
* Click "I'm in class" when you're in one of your classes
* Click on your class' name
Done before your teacher finished saying his name!

## Why
### Your questions deserve answers.
Our app allows you to create questions with their own thread where students can reply directly to it, so you never lose the converstaion. Miss a day? Post a question about what happened that day. Want to connect for studying? Post a time and all of your peers can RSVP.
